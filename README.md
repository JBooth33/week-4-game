# week-4-game
A random number between 19 and 120 is randomly generated to start the game.
4 crystals are then assigned random numbers from 1-12.
The user clicks on the crystals and adds value to their number to try to hit the target  number exactly.
The player wins if they hit the target, or they lose if they go over.
